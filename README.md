## How to run a DDoS attack

_You probably already know the difference between DoS and DDoS:_
_A DoS Attack is run by a single Maschine and a DDoS Attack by multiple._

_But how do we perform a DDoS Attack using Raven-Storm?_


To connect multiple instances of Raven-Storm, you will then need to open a host.
Just execute the command `server` and define a custom password to prevent others from interfering.
When run, you will receive a URL that you can connect to when executing the `ddos` command.
